WHY THIS EXISTS

HybridChunker never merges across a heading boundary, and in HybridChunker the
heading path is the ENTIRE merge predicate:

    if headings == current_headings and fits(candidate):
        merge

So every heading the layout model gets wrong is two faults at once: a boundary
that should not be there, and a wrong string prepended into the embedded text
of every chunk beneath it.

Measured on a 7-page research report: 16 detected SECTION_HEADERs, about half
of them real. `through 2024.` is a heading. So is `Exhibit 6:`. So is a
hundred-character sentence beginning "Please click here for the full excel
database".


WHY CHANGING THE LABEL DOES NOT WORK — READ THIS BEFORE EDITING

The obvious demotion is `item.label = DocItemLabel.TEXT`. It does nothing, and
it does nothing SILENTLY. From HierarchicalChunker.chunk():

    for item, level in dl_doc.iterate_items(with_groups=True, ...):
        if isinstance(item, TitleItem | SectionHeaderItem):
            level = item.level if isinstance(item, SectionHeaderItem) else 0
            ...
            heading_by_level[level] = item
            continue

The test is `isinstance`. The `label` field is never consulted for this
decision. A SectionHeaderItem whose label says TEXT is still a
SectionHeaderItem, so it is still captured as a heading, and the `continue`
means its text is not emitted as content either.

Pydantic permits the assignment because validate_assignment is off. Nothing
raises. A version of this file that logged "demoted 4 false heading(s)" ran
for two full ingestions and changed not one chunk boundary.

    HOW TO DEMOTE, ACTUALLY

        self_ref "#/texts/99"  ->  index 99 in doc.texts
                                        |
                                        v
                      construct a TextItem from the same fields
                                        |
                                        v
                              doc.texts[99] = new item

    self_ref is preserved, so every RefItem pointing at it still resolves and
    the parent's children list needs no edit.


WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO

    It does NOT delete anything. The words stay in the document and become
    part of the chunk around them instead of splitting one.

    It does NOT fix OCR. `Al Agent Vendors` keeps its misread capital I here;
    that is an extraction problem.

    It does NOT touch TitleItem. A document title is a real heading.

# Each pattern below was derived from a real mislabelled heading, not

#
# The third was a sentence fragment which SENTENCE_END catches anyway. So at

    WHY THIS EXISTS WHEN DOCLING ALREADY ASSIGNS LEVELS

    HeadingHierarchyOptions infers depth from bookmarks, then numbering
    markers, then visual style, and compresses the result relative to the
    signals present in each scope. That compression is what makes it robust on
    documents with no numbering at all — and what makes it unreliable on a
    document whose numbering is already unambiguous.

    Measured on a 112-page clinical protocol, with Docling's own assignment:

        d2  1 Background              top-level sections landing at
        d1  2 Study Rationale         inconsistent depths
        d2  3 Experimental Plan
        d1  4 Study Objectives
        d3  4.1 Safety and Tolerability      4.1 three deep
        d4  4.2 Clinical Efficacy            4.2 deeper than 4.1
        d3  4.2.2 Subject Evaluation         4.2.2 SHALLOWER than its parent
        d1  I. Disease Parameters            same level as 8 Appendices,
                                              so it REPLACED it

    Every one of those is unambiguous in the text itself. `4.3.1.2.1` states
    its own depth; no inference is needed or wanted.

    Seven Docling configurations were tested against the last of those —
    scheme order, bookmark threshold, style off, bookmarks off, max_level, a
    different PDF backend — and none improved on the default. The signal that
    fixes it was in the heading text the whole time.

    UNNUMBERED HEADINGS NEST, THEY DO NOT REPLACE

    An unnumbered heading gets one level deeper than the last numbered
    heading seen. That is the fix for the RECIST appendix: `I. Disease
    Parameters` follows `8.5 RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST Guidelines` (level 2), so
    it becomes level 3 and nests under it rather than displacing `8
    Appendices`. Same rule handles `Tumor Microenvironment` and `NOTE 2:`.

    WHEN THIS PASS DOES NOTHING

    Below MIN_NUMBERED_SHARE numbered headings, the document has no numbering
    convention to read and the pass returns without touching anything —
    Docling's own inference is better than a rule with no evidence. An
    unnumbered corpus is left entirely to HeadingHierarchyOptions.

    Runs AFTER clean_headings, deliberately: a demoted heading is no longer a
    SectionHeaderItem and must not participate in the level sequence.
