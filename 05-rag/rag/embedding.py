THE CACHE KEY IS (model, text), AND THAT MATTERS

The key fully determines the result, so this cache cannot go stale. Contrast a
cache keyed on a filename, where changing a setting returns work made under the
old one and the change appears to have done nothing.

Returns a numpy array, NOT lists. Seven times less memory at corpus scale, and
`sync.py` calls `.tolist()` at the point of upsert.


The cache is what makes experimentation free. Re-running after a chunking or
retrieval change re-embeds nothing, and boilerplate shared across documents is
embedded once for the whole corpus.

Its key is (model, text), which fully determines the result — so unlike a cache
keyed on a filename, this one cannot return work made under different settings.

    Ingesting a large corpus should never hold every vector in memory at once. A
    250-page document produces thousands of chunks, and materialising all of them
    before the first upsert makes peak memory a function of document size — which
    is exactly what decides whether a Fargate task fits its memory limit.

    Windowing keeps that flat regardless of how long the document is.

    WHY `batch` IS A CEILING, NOT THE ACTUAL SLICE SIZE

    Slicing purely by COUNT is what broke two documents in a 20-document run:

        Requested 458743 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request
        Requested 312649 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request

    512 chunks at up to CHUNK_TOKENS each is ~524,000 tokens in one request —
    well past OpenAI's hard limit — and neither document had an oversized
    record. Every chunk was individually fine; the AGGREGATE was not.

    `_batches()` below already solves this exactly, closing a batch before
    adding a text that would push it over OPENAI_EMBED_MAX_TOKENS. This
    function used to bypass it entirely and slice by count instead, so the
    token budget was never consulted on this code path at all. It now defers
    to `_batches()` for the real split and treats `batch` as an upper bound on
    the count, so both limits hold: never more than `batch` texts, and never
    more than the token budget, whichever binds first.
