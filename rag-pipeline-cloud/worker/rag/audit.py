"""The audit trail, written to DynamoDB when running on AWS.

What gets written, and when:

    ingest one document
            |
            v
    audit.run("STARTED")            -> RUN#<run_id>
            |
            v
    with Stage(audit, "parse"):
            |
            |-- Stage.__enter__()   -> RUN#<run_id>#STAGE#parse   STARTED
            |-- ... the work ...
            |-- Stage.__exit__()    -> RUN#<run_id>#STAGE#parse   OK or FAILED
            |
            v
    ... the same for inspect, figures, chunk, index ...
            |
            v
    audit.run("COMPLETED")          -> RUN#<run_id>   with counts and timing


TWO RECORD SHAPES IN ONE TABLE
------------------------------

    pk = DOC#<doc_id>   sk = RUN#<run_id>                  one per run
    pk = DOC#<doc_id>   sk = RUN#<run_id>#STAGE#<stage>    one per stage

Keying on the document means one query returns its entire history, in order,
across every run it has ever had.


WHY THE STAGE RECORDS EXIST
---------------------------

A run record alone tells you the document failed.

The stage records tell you it failed during `parse`, forty minutes in — which
points at memory rather than at credentials, and those have completely
different fixes.

The STARTED record is written BEFORE the work begins, deliberately. A stage
with a start and no end is a container that was killed mid-stage, and no
amount of after-the-fact logging can tell you that: the process was gone
before it could write anything.


WHEN THERE IS NO TABLE
----------------------

Every method becomes a no-op. That is not a special "local mode" — it is the
same code path with a None table, so the notebook and the Fargate task run
identical lines and there is no local-only bug to find later.
