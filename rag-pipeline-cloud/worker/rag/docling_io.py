WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO

    It does NOT chunk.
    It does NOT embed.
    It does NOT decide what is worth keeping.

It returns the parsed document. Everything after that is `inspect.py`,
`tables.py` and `chunking.py`.

THE TRAP: almost every enrichment is OFF by default. A default
PdfPipelineOptions() gives you text and little else — an equation becomes the
placeholder `formula-not-decoded` and its content is gone, with no error.

THE LAYOUT MODEL DECIDES MORE THAN IT LOOKS LIKE

Everything downstream keys off the layout model's labels. A region it calls
SECTION_HEADER becomes a heading in the chunker, which is a chunk boundary AND
the string prepended into every vector beneath it. A caption it fails to
associate with a figure becomes an orphan text element, and the figure loses
its exhibit number.

Both of those are layout-model output, not chunker behaviour, and `LAYOUT_MODEL`
below is the only setting that changes them at the source. `headings.py` exists
to repair what the model gets wrong; the cheaper fix is for it to be wrong less
often.

WHY FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ARE CACHED HERE AND NOT LEFT TO DOCLING

Chunk ids are hashes of chunk text, and a figure's description is part of that
text. The vision model is the only non-deterministic stage in this pipeline —
temperature=0 and a fixed seed make OpenAI best-effort reproducible, not
reproducible — so re-parsing an unchanged PDF can reword sixteen descriptions,
change sixteen chunk ids, and make `sync.py` delete and re-embed every figure in
the document.

It is also the only stage that costs money per call, and `parse_pdf` re-parses
every time by design.

So the description step is taken out of Docling's pipeline and run here against
a cache keyed on the rendered image bytes, the prompt and the model — the same
shape `tables.py` already uses for table image summaries, and `embedding.py` for
vectors. Change the prompt, the model or the render scale and the key changes.
Change nothing and the description is byte-identical, forever, for free.

Set CACHE_FIGURE_DESCRIPTIONS=0 to hand the step back to Docling.

# CREATE_ORPHAN_CLUSTERS all become inert under it, because there is no
# bounding-box detector left for them to configure. Set only one at a time.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Every false heading found in this pipeline — 'Exhibit 6:', 'through 2024.',
# the two coloured-box labels — comes from the same source: a bounding-box
# classifier labelling a region by its VISUAL shape (bold, isolated, larger
# font) with no notion of what the text around it means. A VLM reads the
# whole page holistically and can in principle use that context — "this text
# sits inside a labelled box, inside a numbered exhibit" — the way
# clean_headings.py's four hand-written rules currently try to approximate
# after the fact.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, NOT YET MEASURED ON THIS CORPUS
#
# A VLM's failure mode is different in kind, not just in rate: not a
# mislabelled region but hallucinated text, or reading order that drifts on a
# dense page — a risk that rises with exactly the kind of exhibit-packed
# layout this pipeline was built for. Unlike a false heading, a hallucination
# does not show up as a suspicious line in a heading list; it shows up as text
# that was never on the page. Read the output by hand before trusting it.
#
# Requires the vlm extra: pip install "docling[vlm]" transformers. First run
# downloads Granite-Docling-258M and will be slower per page than the default
# stack — budget time before running it across a large corpus.

# PARSE_PIPELINE=vlm; inert otherwise.
#
# WHY IT MIGHT MATTER
#
# A generative model producing text token by token can hallucinate — a number
# that was never on the page, rendered in confident, well-formatted prose.
# Taking text from the extracted layer removes that risk entirely for
# born-digital PDFs, which is every document in this corpus.

# "when enabled (DOCTAGS format only), bounding boxes from the VLM are used

# DOCTAGS, does nothing. This setting now forces both together; see
# _build_vlm_converter for where.
#
# WHAT IT IS STILL NOT KNOWN TO FIX
#
# The measured failure on this corpus was that the VLM pipeline emitted ZERO
# TABLE elements on a document with three, in two runs — one of which had
# this flag on without the DOCTAGS precondition it needs, making that run
# uninformative rather than a real test. Forcing DOCTAGS is the first
# configuration that actually matches the documented behaviour, but the docs
# describe it as routing text through deterministic extraction for regions
# the model ALREADY CALLED a table — not as adding table detection that
# wasn't happening. Check the TABLE count before concluding anything.

# Docling's own fix for the flat-heading problem this pipeline has carried as
# a known limitation since the first parse: every SECTION_HEADER on the PDF
# path comes back level=1, so `8.2` and `8.3.2` are siblings of `8`, and
# headings.py has never had a hierarchy to work with.
#
# THE MECHANISM, NOT ON THE SAME PATH AS ANYTHING ELSE HERE
#
# HeadingHierarchyOptions runs a SEPARATE stage, right after reading order,
# that REWRITES SectionHeaderItem.level using three signals in priority
# order: the PDF's own bookmarks/table of contents, then a numbering marker
# on the heading text itself ('8.2', 'A3a.'), then visual style as a last
# resort. It does not touch which regions get called headings in the first
# place — that is still the layout model and clean_headings' job — and it
# has NO interaction with captions, figure linking, or reading order. Those
# are a different, non-configurable mechanism entirely (Docling's own
# maintainers: "isn't user-configurable"). This fixes DEPTH, nothing else.
#
# OFF BY DEFAULT — AND DOCLING'S OWN DOCS SAY WHY
#
# "a wrong level is worse than a missing one for pipelines already tuned
# around flat headings." That is this pipeline, exactly: section_id,
# headings.py's box-label rule, and every heading-path comparison in
# chunking.py were all measured against flat level=1 output. Turning this on
# changes what "the heading path" means for every document it touches, and
# nothing downstream has been re-verified against a hierarchical one yet.
#
# THE PRECONDITION THAT IS EASY TO MISS
#
# The style fallback signal reads the parsed PDF cells, which Docling drops
# by default. Forgetting to also set generate_parsed_pages=True makes the
# THIRD signal silently unavailable — not an error, just one less thing
# checked. Handled automatically below rather than left as a thing to
# remember, the same kind of precondition that got missed once already this
# session on a different setting.

# Override the numbering-scheme precedence the hierarchy stage uses to rank
# heading markers. Comma-separated, highest level first. Empty means Docling's
# default order:
#

#     PART I  CHAPTER 1  ARTICLE 1    I.        1.        A.         (a)        (i)
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT
#
# roman_u outranks arabic by default, which is correct for legal documents
# where `I.` genuinely IS the top level. It is wrong for a document numbering
# its own sections in Arabic that happens to embed an appendix using Roman
# numerals internally.
#
# Measured on a 112-page clinical protocol: the RECIST appendix numbers its
# own subsections I./II./III. Because roman_u outranks arabic, `I. Disease
# Parameters` was assigned the same depth as `8 Appendices` and REPLACED it in
# the heading stack:
#
#     8 Appendices > 8.5 RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST Guidelines      correct
#     I. Disease Parameters for RECIST 1.1                       <- root lost
#     I. Baseline Assessments in irRECIST > 8.8 List of Abbrev.  <- inverted
#
# 28 of 278 chunks (10.1%, pages 100-110) inherited a broken root, and three
# genuine section-8 headings ended up nested under a subsection that had ended
# pages earlier. The stack only recovered at `9 References`.
#
# Moving arabic above roman_u fixes it while leaving the appendix's own
# internal I. -> A. -> 1. hierarchy intact:
#
#     DOCLING_NUMBERING_SCHEMES=arabic,roman_u,alpha_u,alpha_l,roman_l
#
# Dropping roman_u below alpha_u as well would fix the same bug but invert the
# appendix internally, so prefer the narrower change.

# How close a PDF bookmark's title must be to a detected heading before Docling
# treats the bookmark as authoritative for that heading. 0-1, default 0.8.
#
# WHY LOWERING IT CAN FIX A HIERARCHY THAT NUMBERING CANNOT
#
# Bookmarks rank ABOVE both numbering and style. When one matches, the outline
# — the author's own declared hierarchy — wins outright, and every collision
# between competing numbering schemes becomes irrelevant.
#
# The NSCLC protocol carries a complete five-level outline: 1 Background
# through 9 References, with 8 Appendices properly containing 8.1-8.8. It does
# NOT contain `I. Disease Parameters`, `21.`, `26.`, `NOTE 2:` or `TO:` — the
# outline already knows those are not sections. Every heading problem measured
# on that document is a numbering-inference problem the outline sidesteps.
#
# Matching can still fail on title similarity. Docling compares titles with
# and without their numbering prefix, but small differences still count: the
# outline entry `6  Study Drug Preparation and Administration` carries a
# double space the detected heading may not have. And when the backend
# supplies no page numbers — the docling-parse backends read a native ToC with
# titles and hierarchy but no positions — matching falls back to titles alone
# with a stricter threshold to compensate.
#
# Lowering this admits looser matches. Too low and a bookmark claims the wrong
# heading, which is its own kind of wrong; 0.6 is a reasonable first step down
# from the 0.8 default.

# Deepest heading level assigned; anything deeper is clamped. Docling's default
# is 6.
#
# The NSCLC protocol's deepest legitimate path is 4.3.1.2.1 — five levels. A
# lower ceiling clamps over-deep nesting in an appendix without touching the
# main protocol, which is a blunter instrument than fixing the scheme ranking
# but does not depend on getting the ranking right.

DOCLING_HEADING_MAX_LEVEL = None if _max_level is None else int(_max_level)

# Which PDF backend reads the file. "" uses whatever docling picks by default.
# "pypdfium2" selects PyPdfiumDocumentBackend.
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS FOR HEADING HIERARCHY SPECIFICALLY
#
# Docling's own docs on the bookmark signal:
#
#   "The pypdfium2 backend returns the richest outline: title, depth, target
#    page and vertical position. The docling-parse backends read their own
#    native table of contents, which carries titles and hierarchy but no page
#    numbers — matching then falls back to titles alone, with a stricter
#    similarity threshold to compensate."
#
# So the backend decides whether bookmark matching has page numbers to work
# with. On a document whose outline is correct but whose headings are not
# matching it, this is a more promising lever than bookmark_match_threshold —
# a stricter INTERNAL threshold applies on the title-only path regardless of
# what the option is set to, which would explain a threshold change having no
# measurable effect.
#
# Measured on the NSCLC protocol: the PDF carries a complete 5-level outline
# (1 Background .. 9 References, with 8 Appendices containing 8.1-8.8) that
# does NOT contain the RECIST appendix's I./II./III. markers. Sections 1-9
# come out clean; the appendix does not. Whether that is a matching failure or
# simply the outline's granularity is what changing this setting tests.
DOCLING_PDF_BACKEND = os.getenv("DOCLING_PDF_BACKEND", "").strip().lower()

# The first and normally authoritative signal — the PDF's own outline.
#
# WHY TURNING IT OFF IS WORTH TESTING RATHER THAN ASSUMED HARMFUL
#
# Bookmarks rank above numbering and style, so when one matches a heading it
# decides that heading's level outright. That is usually what you want: the
# outline is the author's own declared hierarchy.
#
# But the docs also note bookmarks can PROMOTE a mis-classified list item to a
# section header — "the only structural change the stage ever makes" — and
# matching is fuzzy, by title similarity. A bookmark that matches the WRONG
# heading, or promotes something that should have stayed a list item, is a
# failure that no amount of numbering tuning can reach, because numbering
# never runs for a heading a bookmark already claimed.
#
# On the NSCLC protocol every numbering-side lever was tried and none improved
# on the default. That is consistent with bookmarks already deciding these
# headings — in which case the numbering settings were aimed at a signal that
# never ran. Turning bookmarks off is the one way to find out: if the result
# changes at all, bookmarks were in play; if it is identical, they were not,
# and the RECIST subsections genuinely fall through to numbering.
#
# Either answer is worth having. Expect a WORSE overall result when off —
# sections 1-9 currently come out clean and the outline is likely why — so
# this is a diagnostic, not a fix.

    That matters here. The measured difference between two layout models on one
    document was large enough to change which regions came out as tables, so
    "we asked for heron_101 and got something adjacent to it" is not a
    difference this pipeline can afford to be unsure about.

    So the preset path is tried first, by name, and the legacy path is the
    fallback. Which one ran is printed, because the two are not guaranteed
    equivalent and a comparison between layout models is worthless if you do
    not know which API produced each side.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO

        It does not raise. An unknown name, a build without either API, or a
        model whose weights will not load all print and leave the default in
        place. A parse that silently used a different layout model than you
        asked for is worse than one that says it could not.

    "Parsing" is several models in sequence, not one. Knowing which is which is

      Layout analysis        Heron by default; heron-101 and the egret family
                             are selectable through LAYOUT_MODEL. Finds the
                             regions on each page and labels them — title,
                             section header, text, list item, caption, table,
                             picture, formula — establishes reading order
                             across columns, and associates captions with the
                             figure or table they belong to. Everything else
                             keys off its output, so a mislabelled region is
                             mislabelled for the rest of the pipeline. Always
                             runs.

      TableFormer            Reconstructs the grid inside a region labelled
                             TABLE: rows, columns, spans, merged cells. This is
                             what export_to_markdown() serialises, and when it
                             collapses a stacked pair into one grid,
                             table_looks_broken() catches it. Runs when
                             do_table_structure is set; ACCURATE mode here.
                             TABLE_CELL_MATCHING controls whether its predicted
                             cells are matched against the PDF's own text cells.

      OCR engine             EasyOCR by default, with Tesseract and RapidOCR
                             pluggable. Only reads regions with no extractable
                             text layer — a scanned page, or a chart with text
                             baked into the image. Digitally generated PDFs
                             skip it entirely. Runs when do_ocr is set; on by
                             default.

      DocumentFigureClassifier
                             Tags each picture as chart, photo, logo or
                             diagram. Cheap, local, and what makes a header
                             wordmark distinguishable from an exhibit after the
                             fact. Runs when do_picture_classification is set.

      CodeFormula            Reads formula and code regions. Without it an
                             equation is emitted as the placeholder
                             `formula-not-decoded` and its content is simply
                             gone. Runs when do_formula_enrichment or
                             do_code_enrichment is set.

      Chart extraction       Torch-backed, reads numeric series out of bar and
                             line charts rather than only describing them.
                             Works from rasterised charts with detectable axes;
                             produces nothing on vector-drawn ones, which is
                             common in financial and research PDFs. Runs when
                             the chart-extraction flag is set.

      Vision model (remote)  VISION_MODEL, called over the API — the only model
                             here that is not local, and the only one that
                             costs money. Writes the description that makes a
                             chart searchable at all. Runs in describe_figures()
                             AFTER the parse, against a cache, unless
                             CACHE_FIGURE_DESCRIPTIONS is off.

    The local models are downloaded from public HuggingFace repositories on
    first use (~500 MB) and cached by huggingface_hub thereafter.

    Every call re-parses the PDF itself. There is no cache for that on purpose:
    the output depends on the settings above as much as on the file, so a cache
    keyed on the filename returns work done under different settings and makes
    a changed setting look like it did nothing. Getting that key right means
    hashing the layout model, the area threshold, the render scale and the
    enrichment flags — machinery that exists only to serve the cache, and that
    is wrong in a way nobody notices.

    The expensive part is cached anyway, one level down: describe_figures()
    keys on the rendered image bytes, which change when any setting that
    affects them changes. That gets the cost and the determinism without the
    invalidation problem.

    Two consequences still follow.

    Iterating on chunking or retrieval re-parses each time. Parse once in the
    notebook and keep `doc` in the kernel; only re-run this cell when a parse
    setting actually changes.

    On AWS, a retried task re-parses from scratch — but reads every figure
    description from the cache, so the retry is free of API cost.

    PARSE_PIPELINE=vlm skips every model above and replaces the whole stack
    with one vision-language model reading each page as an image. See
    _build_vlm_converter. describe_figures() below is unaffected either way —
    it runs after the parse regardless of which stack produced the document,
    against a PictureItem's rendered image, which both paths generate.
