THE IMPORT-TIME READ MATTERS
----------------------------

These values are read from the environment when this module is first
imported, and never again.

So setting an environment variable in a notebook cell AFTER importing the
package has no effect, and nothing warns you — the package simply keeps what
it read. Set them first, or restart the kernel.

Run `python checks/check_config.py` to see what is actually in effect versus what
the environment says.


THE ONE THAT MUST MATCH ON BOTH SIDES
-------------------------------------

EMBED_MODEL.

Ingest with one model and query with another and you get results back, with
scores that look reasonable, that are meaningless. There is no error and no
other symptom.

That is what the manifest in index.py exists to prevent — it records how the
index was built and refuses to run retrieval when the settings disagree.

#
# 1024 is the default because table summaries carry the semantic weight for tabular
# content, so fragments no longer have to stand alone and can stay small enough to

# too many concepts together and blunts both retrieval and reranking.

#
# WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT A MARGIN
#
# Set at exactly 300_000 with no buffer, two documents in a 20-document
# corpus run — 480 records and 493 records — each produced a single
# embeddings request that OpenAI rejected:
#
#     "Requested 304700 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request"
#     "Requested 459215 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request"
#
# Neither document had an oversized record — both runs logged `max 1024`
# tokens per chunk, the CHUNK_TOKENS ceiling, correctly enforced. The
# overshoot happened at the BATCH level, aggregating many compliant records
# into one request that summed past the true cap. `_batches()` closes a
# batch before adding a text that would push it over — correct in principle
# — but a cap set at the exact hard limit has no room to absorb anything:
# a tokenizer that counts even slightly differently from OpenAI's own count,
# rounding, or per-request overhead the API charges but a local count
# doesn't. At zero margin, any of those turns "should fit" into "rejected."
#
# Every other budget in this codebase leaves room on purpose — see
# chunking.py's `_finalise`, which computes the Pinecone metadata budget as
# the hard cap MINUS overhead MINUS a fixed buffer, not the hard cap itself.
# This should have matched that pattern from the start and didn't.
#
# 250,000 leaves 50,000 tokens — about 17% — of headroom under the real
# limit. That is generous enough to absorb a counting discrepancy on a
# single record, not just on the aggregate.

# content. Filtering on area loses exactly those.
#
# 0.01 still excludes rules and bullet glyphs. It does let header logos through, at
# roughly $0.0004 each — under a dollar across a 2,800-page corpus, against losing
# every band and flow diagram in it. Picture classification tags logos, so they stay

# What to run, and what each costs
#
# EVERY ONE OF THESE IS A MODEL PASS, ON CPU, PER ELEMENT.
#
# A 7-page report with 17 figures is not a small document to this pipeline: it
# is 17 crops rendered at 2x, then classified, then chart-extracted, then sent
# to a vision model. Four passes over each figure.
#
# Measure before deciding. `python checks/profile_parse.py your.pdf` times each flag
# separately on your machine with your document, and prints what each one adds.
#
#   TABLE_MODE_ACCURATE   materially better on nested headers, and several
#                         times slower than FAST. Worth it for clinical and
#                         financial tables; probably not for simple grids.
#
#   DO_CHART_EXTRACTION   reads numeric series off rasterised charts. Measured
#                         0 of 17 on vector-drawn charts — which is most
#                         financial and research PDFs. Costs a model pass per
#                         figure and returns nothing on those. Off by default
#                         for that reason.
#
#   DO_CLASSIFICATION     tags each picture chart/photo/logo. Cheap relative to
#                         the others, and what lets you tell a header wordmark
#                         from an exhibit afterwards.
#
#   DO_FORMULA / CODE     CodeFormula. Necessary if your documents contain
#                         equations — without it they become the placeholder
#                         `formula-not-decoded` and their content is gone.

# CONDITIONAL vs UNCONDITIONAL — the distinction that decides what to switch off
#
# Some models run once per element, whether or not that element needs them.
# Others run only where they are needed. Switching off the wrong kind saves
# almost nothing and loses content.
#
#   UNCONDITIONAL      runs on every figure, or every candidate region
#     chart extraction        17 figures = 17 model passes
#     classification          17 figures = 17 model passes
#     formula / code          every candidate region
#     rendering at 2x         four times the pixels, every figure
#
#   CONDITIONAL        runs only where there is work to do
#     OCR                     only regions with NO extractable text layer
#
# On a digital PDF, OCR is nearly free: most text is already in the layer, so
# it runs on a handful of graphic regions and skips everything else.
#
# But it is the ONLY thing that reads text baked into a graphic. An exhibit
# drawn as coloured boxes with a bulleted list inside is invisible without it —
# the caption above and the source line below survive, because those are real
# page text, and everything inside the boxes disappears.

# So: turn off the unconditional ones. Leave OCR on unless you have measured
