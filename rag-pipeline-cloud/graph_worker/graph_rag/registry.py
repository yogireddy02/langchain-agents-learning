"""Trial facts from ClinicalTrials.gov.

This is the authoritative layer. Sponsor, phase, conditions, interventions,
locations and outcomes are all recorded in the registry, so extracting them from a
PDF with a language model would mean paying to guess at facts that are available for
free and correct by definition.

Anything written here carries `source: "registry"`. Layer 3 writes
`source: "extracted"`. That distinction is what lets a query demand facts rather
than accept claims — and it is what makes extraction accuracy measurable, because
the registry is ground truth for every field it covers.

Structure follows the fetch → parse → load separation: the loaders never see the raw
API shape, only the canonical record `parse_trial` produces. Each concern can then be
tested and changed on its own.

The v2 API is public and needs no key.
    https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies/NCT04368728

EVERY NODE GETS A .key

    store.find_chunks() and store.neighbours() — the functions that turn a question's
    words into graph traversal — both search on a `.key` property. Earlier, only the
    extraction layer's six entity types had one; every node written here had a
    domain-specific identity property instead (nctId, name, facility, measure,
    term), and none of them was named `.key`. The effect was silent, not an error:
    a question naming a sponsor, a drug, a disease, a country or a site matched
    nothing, because the property the search ran on simply did not exist on that
    node. The graph was correct; it was just invisible to term search.

    The fix is not to make the search function check five property names instead
    of one — that only holds until a sixth node type shows up. Every node below now
    gets `.key = normalise(...)` on its own display name, using the exact function
    `schema.py` already uses as the extraction layer's identity convention. One
    normalisation function, one identity property, applied everywhere. The
    `find_chunks`/`neighbours` queries in store.py do not change at all — they were
    always correct; they had nothing to find.

    `.key` is for SEARCH. The MERGE identity — what makes a re-run converge instead
    of duplicate — is still each node's own real-world identifier (nctId, name,
    facility, (measure, nctId)), unchanged below. Two different jobs, and conflating
    them would be its own mistake: a Trial's uniqueness is its nctId, not a
    lowercased, noise-stripped string that a differently-titled trial could collide
    with.
