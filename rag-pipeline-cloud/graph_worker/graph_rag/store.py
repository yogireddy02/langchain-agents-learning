"""Writing the graph to Neo4j and querying it.

Everything here is MERGE rather than CREATE, so a re-run converges on the same graph

load, and it depends entirely on the uniqueness constraints below — without one, two
MERGE statements on the same key can both create a node.

Chunk nodes carry an id, a page and a document, and no text. The text lives in the
vector index, and storing it in both places would create two copies to keep in sync.
