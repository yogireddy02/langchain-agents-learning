"""Configuration for the graph layer.

This module is independent of the RAG ingestion pipeline. It does not import it and
does not need its source — the only thing shared between them is a Pinecone index,
and the only identifier shared is `chunk_id`.

That seam is deliberate. The vector store is the source of chunk text; this module
reads from it and writes structure to Neo4j. Neither owns the other, and either can
be rebuilt without touching the other's code.

# The URI scheme decides the connection, and getting it wrong is the most common
# first failure:

#   neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io     Aura. Encrypted, certificate verified.
#   bolt://localhost:7687                 local Docker. Unencrypted.
#
# Aura will refuse a plain `bolt://` connection, and the error talks about routing
# rather than about encryption — which sends people looking in the wrong place.
#
# Aura gives you a credentials file when the instance is created. It contains the
# URI, the username and a generated password, and the password is shown once and
# never again. Put those in the environment; never in a source file.

# Pinecone — read only

# This module never writes to the index. It reads chunk text to extract entities
# from, and reads it again at query time to turn a traversal into an answer. The
# index name and embedding model must match whatever built it, which read_manifest()
# in the ingestion package enforces on its side; here a dimension mismatch surfaces
# as an obvious error rather than as wrong results.

# Which layers actually run
#
# Only structure (layer 1) is universal — every chunk has a doc_id, a position, a
# heading path, so it always produces a Document/Section/Chunk. Registry and
# extraction are not like that:
#
#   registry     needs a real NCT number the document actually names, and needs
#                that trial to exist in ClinicalTrials.gov. A corpus of internal
#                drafts or unregistered protocols can reasonably have NONE.
#
#   extraction   is chunk-scoped, not document-scoped, and is the one layer with
#                a real, ongoing cost — an LLM call per chunk, not a one-time
#                setup step. Building the graph should never spend money as a
#                side effect of someone just wanting the free structure layer.
#
# Both are controlled here rather than by commenting out notebook cells, so the
# choice is one visible setting instead of a cell someone has to remember to
# skip by hand every time they re-run from the top.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Free — a public API call, no LLM involved. On by default: there is no cost to
# weigh against skipping it, only documents with no discoverable or registered
# NCT number, which load_trials() already reports rather than failing on.

# Off by default, deliberately — the one setting in this file with a real,
# ongoing dollar cost (see EXTRACT_MODEL above: roughly $1.50 across a
# 3,000-chunk corpus at gpt-4o-mini). Structure and registry are worth having
# by default because neither costs anything to build; extraction is worth
# having only once someone has decided the six document-only entity types are
# worth paying for, which should be an explicit choice, not what happens the
# first time this notebook is run top to bottom.
