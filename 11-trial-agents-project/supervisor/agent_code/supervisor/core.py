WHY route IS A NESTED GRAPH RATHER THAN REBUILT HERE

create_agent() builds and hides its own StateGraph — model node, tool
node, a conditional edge looping until the model stops calling tools.
That loop already carries ToolStrategy and the budget/require-a-call
middleware. Nesting the compiled agent as this graph's one probabilistic
node keeps those intact while making the OUTER shape — probabilistic,
deterministic, probabilistic — an inspectable graph rather than three
function calls that merely happen to run in order.

WHERE EVERYTHING COMES FROM

    model             OpenAI chat model; key and model name from Secrets Manager
    system prompt     Bedrock Prompt Management, version pinned in Parameter
                      Store; the AVAILABLE AGENTS block is rendered from the
                      registry, so it can never name an agent that is not there
    compose prompt    Bedrock Prompt Management, rendered per question
    specialists       Parameter Store registry: each specialist writes its own
                      ARN and description there when it deploys
    guardrail         ApplyGuardrail — on the question (INPUT), on every model
                      turn, and on the composed answer (OUTPUT)

FIVE FACTS VERIFIED AT RUNTIME, NOT ASSUMED

    1. Middleware state must be declared with `state_schema` (a subclass
       of AgentState). `state_schema_extra` — used by the previous
       version — is not a LangChain attribute: it is ignored and every
       Command update is silently dropped, so call_count stayed 0 and
       RequireAgentCallMiddleware could never see a call that happened.
    2. Under ainvoke, a middleware defining only wrap_tool_call raises
       NotImplementedError on the first tool call.
    3. The same is true of wrap_model_call: sync-only raises
       NotImplementedError under ainvoke. Both forms are defined here.
    4. A tool returning Command must carry the real tool_call_id. The
       previous version passed "" from inside the tool and patched it in
       middleware; the tool now takes InjectedToolCallId, which LangChain
       fills in, so the id is never wrong.
    5. ToolStrategy, not a bare response_format schema — otherwise the
       model can be structurally prevented from calling any tool and
       will answer having called no specialist at all.

WHY DATA STILL NEVER FLOWS THROUGH THE MODEL

call_agent's result is a specialist's full response — graph nodes,
passages, rows. The routing model sees a compact summary; the full response
goes to state for compose() and the final response to read directly.

The summary carries VALUES only for small results (up to 5 rows or nodes),
because a resolution step exists to hand an identifier — a docId — to the
next call. Hiding it cost a second round trip in production.

WHAT THE COMPOSER READS, AND WHAT IS SHOWN

    evidence()          passages chosen by re-ranker score within a
                        character budget, duplicates dropped, then shown in
                        reading order — not the first N in reading order
    _render_decision()  a table or graph a LATER call consumed (its values
                        reappear in that call's question) was a step, not
                        the answer, and is not rendered
