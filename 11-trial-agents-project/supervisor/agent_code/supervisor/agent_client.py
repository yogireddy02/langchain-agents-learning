THE SESSION ID

invoke_agent_runtime requires runtimeSessionId of 33 to 256 characters
(checked against the service model). An earlier version passed the agent
name — "trial_graph", 11 characters — so every specialist call failed
validation before reaching the Runtime.

It is now "<conversation_id>:<agent_name>":

    same conversation, same specialist   -> same session: the Runtime
                                            routes to the warm microVM
    same conversation, other specialist  -> a different session
    no conversation id supplied          -> a fresh uuid4, so the id is
                                            always long enough

The same conversation_id is sent as the A2A contextId, so the specialist
sees one conversation across turns.

WHY boto3 AND NOT A HAND-SIGNED HTTP CALL

The reference backend signs its own HTTPS call because it relays
message/stream SSE frames to a browser. The specialists here enqueue
exactly one final Message, so message/send is the right method and
boto3 signs it. The specialists authenticate callers by IAM (the
Runtime default); there is no end-user token to propagate because this
corpus has no per-user access control (every chunk's access = public).

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO

    It does not export spans. It carries the CURRENT trace context to the
    specialist inside the A2A message metadata; the specialist's main.py
    attaches it, so its spans join this trace. Not through
    invoke_agent_runtime's traceParent parameter — see call_specialist.

    It does not retry. A failed specialist call raises AgentCallError; the
    call_agent tool turns that into a result the model can act on.
