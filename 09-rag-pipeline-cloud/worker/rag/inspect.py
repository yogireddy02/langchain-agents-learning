Extraction and chunk verification reports.

Overall verification flow:

    Parsed Docling document
            |
            v
       inspect()
            |
            |-- count extracted elements
            |-- detect silent extraction failures
            |-- print warnings
            |
            v
    write_extraction_report()
            |
            |-- write every extracted element
            |-- preserve document/page order
            |-- record extraction problems
            |-- create Markdown + JSON reports
            |
            v
        YOU READ THE REPORT
            |
            v
       only then:
       chunk + embed


WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------

Extraction failures do not necessarily raise exceptions.

For example, if a Docling enrichment feature is disabled or fails silently:

    - a figure may have no description
    - a chart may have no extracted data
    - a formula may remain as "formula-not-decoded"
    - a table may have incorrect row/column structure
    - a table may fail to serialize correctly

The important problem is that downstream processing can still continue.

The chunking stage may happily process whatever text it receives, and the
embedding stage may happily embed those chunks.

This can produce an index that looks healthy while important information
such as tables, figures, charts, or equations is missing.

Therefore, this module intentionally sits BEFORE chunking and embedding.

It gives us two levels of verification:

1. Extraction report
   ------------------
   Answers:

       "Did Docling extract the document correctly?"

   It shows every extracted element and highlights suspicious or missing
   content.

2. Chunk report
   -------------
   Answers:

       "Is the exact text that will be embedded correct?"

   It shows the final chunk text, token counts, metadata, table summaries,
   truncation, and other information relevant to retrieval quality.

This separation is important because a document can be extracted correctly
but still be chunked incorrectly.

    dropped into other folders, and a file called `extract.md` on its own says
    nothing about which document it came from.
