THE CACHE KEY IS (model, text), AND THAT MATTERS

The key fully determines the result, so this cache cannot go stale. Contrast a
cache keyed on a filename, where changing a setting returns work made under the
old one and the change appears to have done nothing.

Returns a numpy array, NOT lists. Seven times less memory at corpus scale, and
`sync.py` calls `.tolist()` at the point of upsert.


The cache is what makes experimentation free. Re-running after a chunking or
retrieval change re-embeds nothing, and boilerplate shared across documents is
embedded once for the whole corpus.

Its key is (model, text), which fully determines the result — so unlike a cache
keyed on a filename, this one cannot return work made under different settings.

    WHY SPLITTING BEATS A SAFETY MARGIN

    `_batches` sizes requests from a LOCAL token count, and that count can be
    badly wrong. Measured on a 192-page protocol whose front matter is a
    letter-spaced table of contents (`1 . 4 . 3 . R a t i o n a l e`) with
    non-breaking spaces: tiktoken counted 248,384 tokens for a batch the API
    then rejected at 461,281 — an undercount of 1.86x. Nineteen other
    documents in the same corpus agreed closely, because ordinary prose
    tokenizes predictably and pathological text does not.

    No fixed margin survives that. Lowering the budget until this document
    fits would double the request count for every normal document and still
    guess wrong on the next corpus.

    So this stops predicting and starts measuring. The API knows exactly when
    a request is too large; it says so with a specific error code. Catch that,
    halve the batch, try each half. A normal batch goes through in one call.
    A pathological one splits as far as it needs to, whatever the ratio turns
    out to be.

    A single text that is still rejected alone cannot be split further and
    raises — that is a genuinely oversized record, not a batching problem, and
    chunking.py's truncation pass should have caught it.

    Ingesting a large corpus should never hold every vector in memory at once. A
    250-page document produces thousands of chunks, and materialising all of them
    before the first upsert makes peak memory a function of document size — which
    is exactly what decides whether a Fargate task fits its memory limit.

    Windowing keeps that flat regardless of how long the document is.

    WHY `batch` IS A CEILING, NOT THE ACTUAL SLICE SIZE

    Slicing purely by COUNT is what broke two documents in a 20-document run:

        Requested 458743 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request
        Requested 312649 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request

    512 chunks at up to CHUNK_TOKENS each is ~524,000 tokens in one request —
    well past OpenAI's hard limit — and neither document had an oversized
    record. Every chunk was individually fine; the AGGREGATE was not.

    `_batches()` below already solves this exactly, closing a batch before
    adding a text that would push it over OPENAI_EMBED_MAX_TOKENS. This
    function used to bypass it entirely and slice by count instead, so the
    token budget was never consulted on this code path at all. It now defers
    to `_batches()` for the real split and treats `batch` as an upper bound on
    the count, so both limits hold: never more than `batch` texts, and never
    more than the token budget, whichever binds first.
