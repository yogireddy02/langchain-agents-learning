WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO

    It does NOT call the embedding model.
    It does NOT write to Pinecone.
    It does NOT parse the PDF or run any vision model.

THE THREE THINGS THE CHUNKER WILL NOT DO FOR YOU

HybridChunker only splits, and merges consecutive chunks with an equal heading
path. Four stages, and only the last combines anything:

    HierarchicalChunker      one chunk per detected element
    _split_by_doc_items      window the items to fit the token budget
    _split_using_plain_text  semchunk whatever is still oversized
    _merge_chunks_with_matching_metadata     only when merge_peers=True

Nothing filters, nothing enforces a minimum, and the merge is blind to element
type. So three policies are ours:

    what is not worth indexing        _to_entries, the drop filter
    how small a prose record may be   _merge_prose and _apply_floor
    figures are one record each       _to_records

Every non-obvious decision here was measured. The measurements, and the
failures that produced them, are in DESIGN.md. This file says WHAT; that one
says WHY, and is worth reading once before changing anything.

    A `figure_slot` entry is different going in — no `body` yet, just refs to
    resolve:

        {"kind": "figure_slot", "refs": ["#/pictures/2"],
         "head": [...], "page": 2, "page_end": 2}

    One entry becomes exactly one record — EXCEPT a figure_slot, which
    becomes zero or more (one per picture inside it, via _figure_records),
    and a table entry, which also seeds `table_groups` for _table_summaries
    to turn into one further record.

    Builds two things that are not the same:

        records       every record, in reading order
        table_groups  those records belonging to a table, grouped by table

    A large table appears once in `records` per fragment, and once in
    `table_groups` as the list of all its fragments.
