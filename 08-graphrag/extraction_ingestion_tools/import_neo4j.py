WHY THIS REFUSES ON A NON-EMPTY DATABASE BY DEFAULT

A fresh Aura instance is empty, and that is the case this is built for.
Running this against a database that already has data in it would add a
second, disconnected copy of the graph on top of whatever is already
there — nothing gets overwritten, but the result is confusing and hard to
undo by hand. --force skips this check for anyone who genuinely wants
that.

WHY _importId IS REMOVED AFTERWARD

Without this, every node in the target database would carry a leftover
property no node in the source database has — the graph would not
actually match what was exported, only look like it does until someone
runs a query that includes it. Removed in STEP 6 specifically so the
result is indistinguishable from a graph built natively, not from an
import.
