                                       to its endpoints by export_id,

    write ONE json file: {nodes: [...], relationships: [...]}            (STEP 3)

WHY export_id EXISTS AND NEO4J'S OWN elementId() DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE FILE

elementId() (or, on an older server, id()) is a handle into THIS database —
it means nothing in a student's own, separate Neo4j instance, and reusing
it there would either collide with unrelated nodes or simply refer to
nothing. export_id is assigned fresh during this export, purely to let
import_neo4j.py reconnect the right two nodes when it recreates
relationships; it exists only inside this file and inside the target
database for the few minutes an import takes, then import_neo4j.py
removes it.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO

    - It does not care what labels or relationship types this particular
      graph uses. Every node and relationship is exported exactly as
      found — this is not specific to Document/Section/Chunk/Trial, and
      keeps working if that schema changes later.
    - It does not export indexes or constraints. import_neo4j.py creates
      its own temporary index for the reconnection step and drops it
      afterward; anything the source database's schema needs (uniqueness
      constraints, for instance) is a one-time setup step on the target,
      not something this file carries.
    - It does not compress the output itself. Pass --gzip if the file is
      too large to share as-is.
